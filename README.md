This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## AI — Journal Standup (OpenRouter)

The Journal page's **Standup** section generates a copy-ready weekly update from your journal entries using [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai). Generation happens entirely server-side — the OpenRouter API key never reaches the browser, and journal content is never logged.

### Environment variables

```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=
OPENROUTER_MODEL=google/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it:free
OPENROUTER_FALLBACK_MODEL=google/gemma-4-31b-it:free
```

- **Getting an API key**: sign up at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai), then create a key at [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys).
- **Local development**: add the three variables above to `.env.local` (never commit real values).
- **Vercel**: add the same three variables under Project Settings → Environment Variables for every environment (Development/Preview/Production) that should support the Standup feature. Redeploy after saving.
- **Server-only**: none of these variables use the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix. They are only read inside `lib/ai/*`, `lib/standup.ts`, and `app/api/ai/standup/route.ts` — all server-side code.

### Why a fixed model instead of `openrouter/free`

`openrouter/free` auto-routes each request to a different underlying free model, which produces inconsistent tone and formatting between generations. Planitary always uses the exact model IDs configured in `OPENROUTER_MODEL` / `OPENROUTER_FALLBACK_MODEL`. If either variable is unset, or is set to `openrouter/free`, the Standup feature returns a clear "not configured" error instead of silently choosing a different model.

### Fallback behavior

Each generation makes **at most one primary attempt and one fallback attempt**:

1. `OPENROUTER_MODEL` is tried first.
2. If that request fails for a provider-level reason (model unavailable, rate limited, or a timeout), `OPENROUTER_FALLBACK_MODEL` is tried once.
3. If the primary succeeds, the fallback is never called. If both fail, the request fails with a typed error.

To change either model, just update the corresponding environment variable — no code changes are required.

### Known limitations of free OpenRouter models

- Free-tier models can change availability, rate limits, or be deprecated by OpenRouter without notice. If generation stops working, verify the configured model IDs are still listed at [openrouter.ai/models](https://openrouter.ai/models).
- Free models may have lower/variable request-per-minute limits than paid models; the Standup feature applies a request timeout and a single fallback attempt, but does not implement retry-with-backoff or per-user quotas.

### Where things live

| Concern | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Feature-agnostic AI types/errors | `lib/ai/types.ts`, `lib/ai/errors.ts` |
| Model + generation-parameter config | `lib/ai/config.ts` |
| Generic provider interface + fallback policy | `lib/ai/provider.ts` |
| OpenRouter implementation | `lib/ai/openrouter-provider.ts` |
| Standup prompt builder (Journal-specific) | `lib/ai/prompts/standup-prompt.ts` |
| Standup data rules (date validation, retrieval, truncation) | `lib/standup.ts` |
| Standup API route | `app/api/ai/standup/route.ts` |
| Standup UI | `app/journal/StandupSection.tsx` |

A future AI-assisted Search feature can reuse `lib/ai/config.ts`, `lib/ai/provider.ts`, and `lib/ai/openrouter-provider.ts` as-is — it only needs its own prompt builder (e.g. `lib/ai/prompts/search-prompt.ts`) and its own entries in `AI_FEATURE_SETTINGS`/`AIFeature`.

### Manual testing checklist

- [ ] With no `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` set, clicking **Generate standup** shows a "not configured" message (no crash).
- [ ] With valid credentials, the default range covers the last 7 days and generation succeeds.
- [ ] Selecting a custom start/end date and generating produces an update scoped to that range.
- [ ] Selecting a reversed range (start after end) or a range over 31 days disables **Generate** and shows an inline error.
- [ ] Selecting a range with zero journal entries shows "No journal entries were found for this date range." without an error banner.
- [ ] The output textarea is editable, and **Copy** copies the edited text (verify by editing then pasting elsewhere).
- [ ] Changing either date after generating clears the previous result.
- [ ] **Regenerate** replaces the output; **Clear** removes it.
- [ ] Journal entry creation, editing, deletion, sorting, and date navigation still all work as before.
- [ ] Dark mode and light mode both render the Standup section correctly.
- [ ] Works on a narrow (mobile-width) viewport without horizontal overflow.
